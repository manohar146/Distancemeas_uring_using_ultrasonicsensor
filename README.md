# Distancemeas_uring_using_ultrasonicsensor
This project uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor connected to an Arduino Uno to measure the distance to an object in centimeters. The result is displayed in real time on a 16x2 LCD with I2C module.
# üìê Ultrasonic Distance Measurement System

## Overview
This project demonstrates a distance measurement system using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino microcontroller. It captures real-time range data and includes documentation, circuit diagrams, and pin mapping for easy replication and understanding.

## Tech Stack
- Arduino (ULIT_SON_Distance.ino)
- Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Serial monitor or display output
- Excel for pin configuration and data logging
- Word documentation for system overview

## Files Included
- `ULIT_SON_Distance.ino`: Arduino sketch for ultrasonic distance measurement
- `ULIT_SON_Distance.docx`: Detailed documentation of system design and operation
- `Ultrasonic_Distance.xlsx`: Pin configuration and optional data logging
- `circuit_image (3).png`: Circuit diagram
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Highlights
- Real-time distance measurement using time-of-flight logic
- Modular code structure for easy adaptation to other sensors or platforms
- Clear documentation and pin mapping for reproducibility
- Visual assets for hardware setup and circuit layout

## How It Works
- The ultrasonic sensor emits pulses and measures the time taken for echoes to return
- Arduino calculates the distance based on time-of-flight and displays the result
- Circuit and pin mapping ensure accurate signal flow and control
